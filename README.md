"Everybody Needs a Little Friend!"

Installing:

1. Download Zip File to your computer
2. Open Zip File so that it expands its consisting files
3. Open chrome://extensions
4. Select "Load Unpacked" in the top left hand side of the browser
5. Select "Project 2 iml300" folder and unpack
6. Turn on your extension and reload
7. Open a new browswer

Instructions:

1. Move Bob around your screen in place of your mouse.
2. Select colors from the Pallette from the art board at the top lefthand side of the screen.
3. Move your mouse around as usual with the extra flair of your painting buddy Bob that sweeps his earthy-toned paint brush across the screen.

Inspiration:

Bob Ross, renound nature-painter has brought smiles to many across the world. Famous long after his passing for his peaceful and positive art tutorial videos that
have skyrocketed in popularity over the course of the past half-decade, he is a very happy figure to many from varying backgrounds. If you need an extra pop of
color in your browswing experience.

Further Development:

A change that I would like to further develop with this extension is to implement the shown brush size in the case that I also incorporate the ability to paint
little images on your screen to bring a simple entertaining task to your usual internet time (with the help of Bob of course).
